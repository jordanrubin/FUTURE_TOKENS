## what it is

**rhyme** is fast structural similarity. it maps a novel input onto known patterns by echo, not deduction. the match may be visual, narrative, functional, or systemic—but it *feels* alike. not true, not proven—just salient.

rhyme is upstream of metaphor, model, and ramify. it clusters, suggests, frames. nothing more—but often the first real foothold.

---

## how it runs (~1–3 s)

1. **register A** – snapshot the input pattern or system  
2. **scan memory** – passive recall of matching structures  
3. **note shared features** – form, role, sequence, function  
4. **tag A ↔ B** – save as active candidate for further analysis

## rhyme tropes

common pattern categories that trigger rhyme:

- **visual motifs** – spirals, cascades, symmetries, recursions  
- **narrative arcs** – fall-from-grace, double agent, forbidden loop  
- **role dynamics** – scapegoat, saboteur, empty throne  
- **formal patterns** – ABBA, edge→core→edge  
- **process analogs** – bottlenecked pipeline, open-loop feedback, stochastic search  
- **systemic frames** – immune response ↔ infosec, political alliance ↔ economic cartel, market panic ↔ stampede  

these act as rhyme scaffolds, even across domains

## parameters

| knob          | range / values                                          | effect                                                |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **tightness**  | loose → strict                                           | how many shared features needed to register a rhyme   |
| **scope**      | local → systemic                                         | whether rhyme is within elements or across processes  |
| **breadth**    | narrow (1–2 matches) → wide (many candidates)           | how many rhymes are held in working memory            |
| **depth**      | surface feature → underlying structure                   | how abstract the match can be                         |
| **agenda**     | neutral / goal-tuned (e.g. “rhyme wrt growth strategy”) | constrain activation by current objective             |

## when to use

- **understanding unfamiliar domains** – bootstrap comprehension via structural echo  
- **creative seeding** – generate multiple reference-class hits before designing  
- **intuition framing** – snap a half-formed hunch to known shape  
- **debugging & sensemaking** – check for recurring structures in divergent settings

## dimensionalization of rhyme

    1. parallel density: how many concrete overlaps (not vibes) can you name?

	•	0.0 = 1 cute overlap
	•	0.5 = ≥2 structural + ≥1 functional
	•	1.0 = ≥3 structural + ≥2 functional, independently checkable

    2. source maturity: is the source domain well-mapped (canon, playbooks, failure literature)?

	•	0.0 = folk wisdom only
	•	0.5 = partial standards, scattered case studies
	•	1.0 = codified heuristics + known traps + metrics

    3. operator expertise (error-spotting): do you know the source deeply enough to catch leaks?

	•	0.0 = tourist
	•	0.5 = competent user
	•	1.0 = can name edge cases & anti-patterns on demand

    4. transfer leverage: how much working know-how could port if the rhyme holds? (rules, heuristics, checklists)

	•	0.0 = decorative frame
	•	0.5 = a couple of useful rules
	•	1.0 = a compact playbook you can run tomorrow

    5. invariants salience: are the shared bits causal/transformational, not ornaments?
	•	0.0 = motif only (spirals, masks)
	•	0.5 = roles/flows line up
	•	1.0 = core constraints & transforms align (queues, budgets, feedbacks)

    6. exclusion clarity (leak-proofing): can you crisply list what doesn’t port?

	•	0.0 = hand-wavy “obviously not everything”
	•	0.5 = a few do-not-ports
	•	1.0 = explicit exclusion set that would catch most dumb misuses


    7.  communicability: can you explain the rhyme in 2–4 bullets to a smart outsider?

	•	0.0 = requires a TED talk
	•	0.5 = intelligible with a diagram
	•	1.0 = lands in 20 seconds, no table needed

    8. measurability: are there observable proxies to test the rhyme quickly?

	•	0.0 = pure vibes
	•	0.5 = qualitative spot-checks
	•	1.0 = leading indicators/metrics exist or are easy to stub

    9. time-scale alignment: do the dynamics rhyme on timescale (latency, cadence, decay)?

	•	0.0 = mismatch (days vs microseconds)
	•	0.5 = can be rescaled with care
	•	1.0 = native alignment or trivial rescaling

    10. composability: does the rhyme play nicely with other rhymes/maps?

	•	0.0 = conflicts with your existing frames
	•	0.5 = orthogonal
	•	1.0 = plugs into a larger scaffold (becomes a module)

    11. novelty (anti-cliché): is it fresh enough to cut new affordances, not generic poster talk?

	•	0.0 = “business is war” tier
	•	0.5 = familiar but specific
	•	1.0 = crisp, surprising, and helpful

## micro-example

an emergent protocol failure pings rhymes like:
- enchanted broom in *fantasia*  
- cascading blackout  
- sorcerer’s apprentice archetype  
- positive feedback loop with no governor  

no formal mapping yet—just a stack of echoes primed for model-building.

## common pitfalls & patches

| pitfall         | symptom                                                 | patch                                                             |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| false positives | superficial resemblances crowding signal                | increase tightness; require functional and structural overlap     |
| anchoring       | early match blocks richer ones                          | erase & re-query with shifted lens                               |
| overreach       | treating rhyme as explanatory                           | explicitly flag as pre-model heuristic                           |

## downstream moves

- **dimensionalize** – filter rhymes for utility, leverage, clarity  
- **metaphor** – borrow intuition  
- **isomorph** – build structural mapping  
- **ramify** – unfold implications across the rhyme

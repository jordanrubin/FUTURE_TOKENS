## tl;dr  
dimensionalization = naming the handful of dials that actually move a system. a *good* dial scores high on three meta-dimensions—**fidelity, leverage, complexity**—and those meta-dims each break into two sub-dims:

| meta-dim | sub-dims | mnemonic |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **fidelity** | validity · stability | “is it *real* and does it hold up?” |
| **leverage** | actionability · impact | “can i twist it, and does twisting matter?” |
| **complexity** | cognitive load · overfitting risk | “can i juggle it, or does it drown me?” |

[[remember: F=valid+stable, L=action+impact, C=load+overfit]]

## meta-dimension 1 – fidelity  
> *does the dial carve reality at the joints?*  
**validity** = tracks an actual difference. **stability** = keeps tracking when zoom, time, or context shift.  
high-Fidelity examples: factor exposure, latency, tempo.  
low-Fidelity: “vibe”, “tech debt”, generic “efficiency”.

---

## meta-dimension 2 – leverage  
> *twist → consequence*  
**actionability** = you control the slider. **impact** = slider moves the outcome.  
good Leverage: autonomy vs stimulation (parenting), modularity (software).  
bad Leverage: “be more strategic”, “gym-playlist bpm”.

---

## meta-dimension 3 – complexity  
> *few enough dials to stay in head-RAM*  
**cognitive load** = how many sliders you must juggle. **overfitting** = dials that add theoretical resolution but no practical gain.  
low-Complexity: strength·endurance·recovery (fitness).  
high-Complexity: 30 biometric streams for a workout plan, 50+ OKRs for five people.
